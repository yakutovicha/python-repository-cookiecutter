# Python Package Cookiecutter

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template to quickly develop a new Python package.


# Features

## Python management

Despite a large variety of tools, we are still using the old-good [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) to manage the package.
This might change in the future, but for now, this is the tool that we know the best.
Other available options are: [flit](https://github.com/pypa/flit), [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch), [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).
